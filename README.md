# Readme

This project aims to build a marketplace API using Ruby on Rails, with the goal of gaining proficiency in the RoR ecosystem. Emphasizing best practices, this endeavor serves as a reference for future projects.

## Versions
- Ruby 3.2.2

## Getting started

### Add to git and push

After you've filled your `README.md` file with your own project's text, you
should push it to your GitHub project:

```shell
git add README.md
git commit -m "Added: README"
git push
```

This adds the `README.md` file to your git repository, creates a commit for it
and pushes it to GitHub (or your preferred remote repository).

## Features

## Contributing

As I use this for my own projects, I know this might not be the perfect approach
for all the projects out there. If you have any ideas, just
[open an issue][issues] and tell me what you think.

If you'd like to contribute, please fork the repository and make changes as
you'd like. Pull requests are warmly welcome.

If your vision of a perfect `README.md` differs greatly from mine, it might be
because your projects are vastly different. In this case, you can create a
new file `README-yourplatform.md` and create the perfect boilerplate for that.

E.g. if you have a perfect `README.md` for a Grunt project, just name it as
`README-grunt.md`.
